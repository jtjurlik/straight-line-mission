# Straight Line Mission
 
Idea inspired by 'the community of straight-line-walkers' and the content of [Ally's Adventures]([url](https://youtu.be/wDfiwpBUN5o?si=g1Egj9Oow4kkxi7k)) in particular.

This repo will aggregate all ideas related to this activity.

*Jan 2025*: Current goal is to automate finding two optimal boundary points from the opposites sides of a defined city. Walkable paths only. Input: city_geocode and max_deviation_m. Outputs the optimal starting and ending coordinates, the maximum deviation along the route, and the map visualization.
